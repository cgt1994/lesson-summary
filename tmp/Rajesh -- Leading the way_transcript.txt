Yeah, yeah, uh, turn it up.
Turn it up.
This one's for the legend.
The leader, the visionary.
Ratchet Sun, down.
Let's go!
From Microsoft Halls to the digital heights.
Ratchet Sun, D'Abron, keep in touch.
Game tight.
27 years, yeah, he's been in the fight.
Action's ripping leader, bring envisioned a light.
Collaboration first.
He moves as a team.
No way the fish and seas keep it crisp.
Keep it clean.
No duplicates.
Kids, now no lines get blurred. Consistency and standards every cold
Every word. He's the one who makes him run, no delay, no slack. Push it quality
In vision, never cut, no track with a mind so sharp in us. Wrazes sun,
Dump from yet, legacy, limbs all. Performance and precision that's
his lane. Every feature measured. Every move well trained. He ain't swayed by
the trends or the original calls. Keep a steady, keep a focus, never let
the vision fall. Outside the grind, he's a cricket fan. Blue jersey
God got the game in his hand
Indy and team every match
Everyone's dreaded, treat it on the field
Just like the work he brings
Fair firm, that's the way he rolls
God and his twins as they chase their goals
Computer science minds
Future looking bright with a father like
Vajaj they go reach new heights
Diesel one who makes it one
No delay, no the envision never cutting
No dollar him yet, it's like a sea
I and it's the leader of gates of impact
Mark on the game
